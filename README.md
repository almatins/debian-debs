Debian Debs

When you are having trouble with debian 10 (buster), 
check your dmesg using this command:

sudo dmesg | grep error

when it fails to load your network card and chipset firmware, try download and install these files (pick two of them, see their filenames).
then reboot.

I hope, you'll find this useful.
